# autoturtle
While the problem of fully autonomous localization and navigation has been studied at length in theoretical terms, and implemented in robots with complex suites of sensors, the feasibility of autonomous robotics in less robust systems is a largely under emphasized problem. I will be exploring the practical implementation of a fully autonomous system using the simple Turtlebot. This research will be primarily focused fully testing and documenting the necessarily components of the system, which will be comprised of several modules: the map, the extended-kalman filter (for local navigation), AprilTags (for global localization), hallway centering, and collision avoidance. The goal is to rigorously test and thoroughly document each component of the system. In thoroughly documenting each component, we will be exploring the feasibility of such an autonomous system with the limited suite of sensors in the Turtlebot.
